This web application helps users discover special birthday offers from various brands. It offers a personalized experience by showcasing predefined brand campaigns based on the user’s birth date using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Key Features

### 1. **Shows Birthday Offers**
- This feature allows users to view special birthday offers from a curated list of brands.
- Each offer comes with **detailed terms and conditions**, such as eligibility requirements (e.g., being a loyalty member) or how to claim the offer.
- Each offer has **expiration dates** clearly displayed, so users know when to redeem the deals.
- Offers are personalized based on the user’s birthday, allowing them to see offers that apply to their special day.

### 2. **Smooth User Interface**
- The website design focuses on providing an **intuitive and user-friendly** experience.
- **Stylish animations** enhance the visual appeal of the site, making transitions between sections and interactions seamless.
- Brand logos are displayed next to their offers, giving the site a polished and professional look.

### 3. **Static JSON File for Campaign Data**
- All birthday campaign data is stored in a **single JSON file**, ensuring that the information remains static and accurate.
- Since the data does not rely on external APIs or live updates, the website provides **consistent and reliable** information without the risk of data retrieval errors.
- The JSON file contains the campaign name, description, terms, expiration dates, and brand logo references.
- This approach helps maintain the integrity of the offers, as they are pre-validated and do not require regular updates.

### 4. **Countdown Timers**
- The dynamic countdown feature shows the **exact amount of time** left until the user’s next birthday.

- The timer is divided into **days, hours, minutes, and seconds** and provides a constantly refreshing real-time countdown. - For users who are not close to their birthdays, the website offers **countdowns** to upcoming campaigns, allowing them to plan future offers.
- Countdowns are paired with engaging visual effects to make the user experience more interactive and exciting.
